Aetherium Hub, by Jonathan Korstad
 - Aetherium Hub contains Aetherium Studio, plus future expansions and tools for generating and precise control over next gen games, media, immersive experiences, and more.

Project Concept: "Aetherium Studio"


  Aetherium Studio is not a new game engine, but a unified development environment and asset pipeline manager. It acts as a
  central hub that connects to and orchestrates a suite of best-in-class, open-source tools and AI services. The core philosophy
  is to automate the tedious aspects of game asset creation while empowering developers with powerful, editable results.

  Core Architecture

  The application will be built on a client-server model, allowing for flexibility and heavy-lifting to be done on a powerful
  machine or in the cloud.


   1. The Hub (Frontend): A web-based application (likely built with React or Vue and packaged with Electron for a native desktop
      feel).
       * Dashboard: Main project view, showing recent assets, tasks, and project status.
       * Asset Library: A unified browser for all generated assets (3D models, textures, audio, scenes). It will feature rich
         previews (a Three.js viewer for .glb/.gltf files, audio players for SFX/music).
       * Generator Interfaces: Dedicated UI sections for each creation task:
           * 3D Asset Prompting: Text/image input that sends requests to 3D generation APIs.
           * Audio Prompting: Text input for generating music and sound effects.
           * Environment Prompting: Text/parameter input for landscape generation.
       * Workflow Manager: A node-based or step-by-step UI to chain operations together (e.g., Prompt Mesh -> Auto-Rig -> Apply
         Animation -> Export to Godot).


   2. The Core (Backend): A Python (FastAPI/Flask) server that acts as the brains of the operation.
       * API Gateway: Manages all external API calls to Hugging Face Spaces, Suno, etc. Securely stores API keys.
       * Job Queue: Manages long-running tasks like 3D rendering, rigging, and scene generation. This is crucial so the UI remains
         responsive.
       * File & Database Management: Stores project data, asset metadata, and handles file I/O, ensuring all assets are correctly
         versioned and stored.
       * The "Agent" Controller: Dispatches tasks to specialized "Worker" scripts.


   3. The Agents & Workers (Automation Layer): These are not a single AI, but a collection of specialized, headless scripts that
      Aetherium Core calls upon.
       * Blender Worker (`bpy`): The primary workhorse for 3D tasks. Aetherium will run Blender from the command line to execute
         Python scripts for:
           * Importing: Bringing in the raw meshes from the generation APIs.
           * Cleaning: Running mesh cleanup, decimation, and optimization routines.
           * Auto-Rigging: Using AI-assisted plugins or heuristics to generate a basic character rig.
           * Animation: Applying animations (e.g., from a library like Mixamo, or future AI animation models).
           * Exporting: Saving the final, processed asset as a clean .glb file.
       * Landscaping Worker:
           * Uses AI (e.g., a custom-trained Stable Diffusion model) to generate heightmaps, splat maps (for textures), and
             foliage maps based on a prompt.
           * These maps can then be fed into Blender's Geometry Nodes or Godot's terrain system by a worker script to procedurally
             build the base environment.
       * Engine-Specific Workers: Scripts that can interact with the project files of Godot, Unity, etc., to automatically place
         exported assets or set up materials.

  Proposed Workflows

  Workflow 1: Creating a Game-Ready Character


   1. Prompting (Hub): User types "A sci-fi soldier in powered armor, cyberpunk style" into the 3D Asset Generator.
   2. Generation (Core -> API): The Core backend sends a formatted request to the TripoSR or TRELLIS Hugging Face Space API.
   3. Ingestion (Core -> Asset Library): The raw 3D mesh (.obj or .glb) is returned. The Core saves it to the project's _raw_assets
      folder and adds it to the Asset Library with a "Needs Rigging" tag. The user can preview it in the Hub's 3D viewer.
   4. Rigging (Hub -> Core -> Blender Worker): User selects the asset and clicks "Auto-Rig & Animate."
       * The Core queues a job for the Blender Worker.
       * The worker launches a headless Blender instance, imports the mesh, and runs a script that could use a tool similar to
         Rigify or an AI-powered placement predictor to create a skeleton.
       * The script then binds the mesh to the skeleton (automatic weights).
   5. Animation (Core -> Blender Worker): The script could then be instructed to fetch a standard "T-Pose" and "Idle Animation"
      from a local library or an external service.
   6. Export (Blender Worker -> Asset Library): The Blender worker exports the final rigged and animated character as
      soldier_v1.glb into the main asset folder. The Hub UI updates, showing the asset as "Ready."
   7. Integration: The user can now drag this asset from the Hub directly into their Godot/Unity editor, or the Hub can have a
      button "Send to Godot" which copies the file to the correct project subfolder.

  Workflow 2: Generating an Environment


   1. Prompting (Hub): User goes to the Environment Generator and types "A volcanic wasteland with jagged black rocks and rivers of
      lava." They can set parameters like size (e.g., 2km x 2km).
   2. Map Generation (Core -> AI Worker): The Core dispatches a job to a worker that uses a diffusion model to generate a 16-bit
      heightmap PNG for the terrain shape and a texture mask for lava rivers.
   3. Scene Construction (Core -> Blender/Godot Worker):
       * Another worker takes these images. It opens a Blender template scene with a pre-configured Geometry Nodes setup.
       * It applies the heightmap to a plane to create the landscape mesh and uses the lava mask to apply an emissive lava material
         in the specified areas.
       * It could also scatter pre-made "jagged black rock" assets (which could themselves be AI-generated) across the terrain.
   4. Export & Tweak (Worker -> Asset Library): The worker exports the entire scene as volcanic_level_v1.glb. The user can import
      this into their engine, or for maximum editability, the worker can save a .blend file that the user can open to manually
      tweak the Geometry Node parameters.

Aetherium Philosophy:

Our goal is to reduce the burden of creating amazing entertainment, media, games. and immersive next generation entertainment.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
